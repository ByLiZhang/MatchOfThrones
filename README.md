# MatchOfThrones

## Overview

> MatchOfThrones is a web version of the classic Memory Match game.  Starting with 18 cards facing down, the player has to try and match all 9 pairs of matching cards by remembering the position of the cards.
Once two cards are matched, they will be displayed facing up until all pairs have been matched. When all pairs have been matched, the user will be shown a message that he/she has won the game, and stats will be displayed to let the user know how many attempts were made and the accuracy of his/her choices.
